# GPIO
Project in VHDL of General Purpose Input/Output

GPIO is an integrated circuit that have generic pin, which can be an Input or Output pin.

We have three files:
- The code itself (GPIO.vhd)
- A testbench of the principal code (GPIO_TB.vhd)
- A file "do" that have the instructions of what must do for simulation (tb_project.do)

Used the programs Quartus 13.0 sp1 and ModelSim_Altera 10.1d.
